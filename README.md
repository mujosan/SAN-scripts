### What is this repository for? ###

This is a collection of Ruby scripts created to assist with my day job as a storage admin.

Version 1.0

### How do I get set up? ###

These scripts are intended to be run on a *nix platform. The Cisco and EMC Clariion/VNX scripts were initially created on a Linux (Centos) server and later "enhanced" on a Solaris machine. IBM SVC scripts created on the Solaris machine.

Clone the repository and amend equipment names to suit local naming conventions. Once SSH/NavisecCLI are installed you're good to go.

* Configuration

All scripts expect the storage equipment to be listed in the /etc/hosts file.

* Dependencies

A server platform that supports /etc/hosts files and NavisecCLI - Solaris (Oracle), AIX, RHEL (or Centos) and MS Windows Server.
The scripts make use of SSH or EMC NavisecCLI
