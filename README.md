### How do I get set up? ###

These scripts are intended to be run on a *nix platform. The Cisco and EMC Clariion/VNX scripts were initially created on a Linux (Centos) server and later "enhanced" on a Solaris machine. IBM SVC scripts created on the Solaris machine.

The scripts make use of SSH or EMC NavisecCLI

* Configuration
All scripts expect the storage equipment to be listed in the /etc/hosts file.

* Dependencies
A server platform that supports /etc/hosts files and NavisecCLI - Solaris (Oracle), AIX, RHEL (or Centos) and MS Windows Server.
